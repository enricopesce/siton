## Reporting a Vulnerability

Siton is a backtesting library with no network-facing components other than optional CCXT exchange data fetching. It does not store credentials, execute live trades, or handle user accounts.

If you discover a security issue (e.g. a code injection path via strategy files or CSV loading), please open a GitHub issue labelled **security** or email the maintainers directly.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and release a patch within 7 days for confirmed vulnerabilities.
